            Hey there! <span className={styles.emoji}>ðŸ‘‹</span>
            <br />
            <br />
            Welcome to my corner of the web! So, what's my story? Well, I've
            always had a passion for marketing, constantly exploring creative
            ways to reach audiences and make an impact.
            <br />
            <br />
            Along the way, I stumbled upon the captivating world of coding, and
            it was like love at first{" "}
            <span className={styles.helloworld}>"Hello, World!"</span>. So here
            I am, building my portfolio to land that first dream job. Despite
            being relatively new to the scene, I'm driven by a strong motivation
            to learn and grow, always ready to tackle any challenge that comes
            my way. <br />
            <br />
            When I'm not crafting websites, you'll often find me shooting hoops
            on the basketball court.
